Please include the reader.py, the test_reader.py, and rms_albums.csv in the same directory
and open a shell and navigate to the directory where those files exist.\n
Enter:

python -m unittest test_reader

or alternatively enter:

python -m unittest

python will run all tests in the directory.


I have also created a csvTool that allows you to write (add,update,get,delete) to the csv directly.
