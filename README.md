Please include both the reader.py and the test_reader.py files in the same directory
and open a shell and navigate to the directory where both files exist.
and enter:

python -m unittest test_reader

or alternatively enter:

python -m unittest

python will run all tests in the directory.


I have also created a csvTool that allows you to write (add,update,get,delete) from the csv directly.
